📈 Stock Market Prediction using LSTM
This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. It leverages deep learning techniques to model time-series data and forecast future trends in the stock market.
🚀 Features
- Load and preprocess historical stock data
- Normalize data for better model performance
- Build and train an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualize predictions vs actual stock prices
- Save and reuse trained models
🧠 Model Architecture
The LSTM model is designed to capture temporal dependencies in stock price movements. It consists of:
- One or more LSTM layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense output layer for final prediction

🛠️ Installation
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ujjaval005/Stock-market-prediction-lstm.git
cd Stock-market-prediction-lstm
- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
- Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
📊 Usage
- Place your stock data CSV file in the data/ directory.
- Run the training script:
python src/train_model.py
- Run the prediction script:
python src/predict.py
- View the prediction results and plots.
📉 Sample Output
The model generates a plot comparing actual vs predicted stock prices, helping visualize its forecasting accuracy.
🧪 Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
(See requirements.txt for full list)
📌 Notes
- The model's accuracy depends heavily on the quality and quantity of historical data.
- You can experiment with different window sizes, LSTM units, and epochs to improve performance.
